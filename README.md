# AddressBook
This is a simple Application which is made to practice Angular basics on my own. It is an Address book which hold 3 input fields.
* name
* surname
* phone
Currently each field is not validated on it's own. The user is only prevented from entering duplicate or empty record.
## Improvements
    To improve the user experience we could add some new fucntions
* Delete Button <b>Done</b>
* Cookie Record Storage
